<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This project examines the trends in COVID-19 positivity rates and
death rates in California and Ohio during 2020 through April 2021, prior
to the widespread availability of vaccines. The analysis examines how
differing government interventions, such as mask mandates and reopening
policies, may have influenced public health outcomes including
positivity rates and death rates. Data was obtained from the COVID
Tracking Project, U.S. Census Bureau, and Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker. This project utilized these databases to provide
insights into the effectiveness of each stateâ€™s pandemic response. The
graphs show the overall testing rates and death rates which can indicate
how the policies may have had effects on these statistics. In the full
analysis, Stringency Index and Health Containment Index were used to
evaluate how the policies affected the health outcomes.</p>

surge in 2020 and early 2021 whereas Ohio did not see as drastic of a
spike.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 Analysis:</strong> This figure shows the death rates
in both California and Ohio from March 2020 to April 2021. Ohio at the
beginning of the pandemic had a higher death rate, but California was
higher during the summer months. The winter surge had an overall higher
rate in California likely due to noncompliance of social gatherings
during the holidays and greater population density. The early increase
of deaths is likely reflective of early lockdown measures and reopening
policies.</p>
