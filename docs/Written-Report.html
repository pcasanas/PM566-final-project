<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had lingering consequences since 2020. Key
to the combat against this pandemic was the rollout of vaccines which
had early access for healthcare workers in December 2020 but later
became available to the general public in April 2021 (Center for Disease
Control 2021). Prior to the vaccines, management was key in preventing
the spread of COVID and varied from state to state. California and Ohio
were chosen for this analysis because they represent contrasting
approaches to pandemic management. California, with its large population
(~39.5 million residents) and stringent measures, provides an example of
an aggressive mitigation strategy. Contrarily, Ohio’s moderate, reactive
approach offers insight into a more flexible response. This comparison
highlights how different strategies influenced pandemic outcomes.</p>
<p>This analysis aims to determine the difference in COVID-19 test
positivity rates and death rates between Ohio and California during 2020
until the point when vaccines were distributed which was approximately
April 2021. By comparing these states’ trends with the national average,
this analysis seeks to understand how both states managed the pandemic
before the vaccines were made available and whether their approaches led
to different outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<p>How did Ohio and California compare in their COVID-19 positive test
rates and death rates prior to the widespread availability of vaccines,
and how do these trends compare with national averages? To what extent
did government intervention levels influence these patterns prior to
vaccines?</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p><strong>Data Acquisition</strong></p>
<p>The datasets are publicly available on
“www.covidtracking.com/data/download”. They provide daily updates on
COVID-19 statistics from all the United States. These variables measured
include test positivity rates, death counts, hospitalizations, and other
COVID-related metrics. The data ends March 2021 just prior to when
vaccines became publicly available in April 2021. For population
estimates, the US Census Bureau was used for their annual state
population estimates for 2020 to calculate death rates.</p>
<p>Data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)
was obtained to provide systematic data on government responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic. This database includes indicators such as the
Stringency Index and the Containment Health Index. The Containment
Health Index is a composite measure, ranging from 0 to 100, that
reflects the strictness of health-related interventions, such as testing
policies, contact tracing, and healthcare investment. This measure
provides a standardized way to compare public health responses across
states and over time.</p>

<p>In summary, the datasets from the COVID Tracking Project, U.S. Census
Bureau, and OxCGRT were downloaded, cleaned, and merged to analyze
COVID-19 positivity and death rate trends in Ohio and California. The
OxCGRT dataset was filtered and extrapolated to include government
intervention indices to assess the impact of policy on pandemic
statistics. Although these indices and pandemic statistics are on
different scales, combining them in one visualization allows for easy
identification of patterns, such as potential decreases in stringency or
containment measures following surges in death rates.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 Analysis:</strong> This figure shows the COVID-19
positivity rate trends for California, Ohio, and the national average
from early 2020 to early 2021. Early in the pandemic, both California
and Ohio displayed high variability in positivity rates, likely due to
testing availability and early cases. After stabilizing, California’s
rate was slightly higher than the national average and Ohio’s rate
during the summer months. Starting around October 2020, California
remained lower than Ohio and the national average which may be
attributed to the stricter policies for gatherings during that time
period.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 Analysis</strong>: This figure shows the cumulative
COVID-19 death rates for California, Ohio, and the national average over
time. Early in the pandemic, death rates rose more gradually in
California than compared to Ohio and the national average, which may
reflect the potential impact of its early and stringent policies. By
late 2020, Ohio and California had similar death rates but then Ohio
increased more rapidly than California around December 2020. The
national death rate consistently was higher than both states, which
highlights the variations in state-level policies and pandemic
responses. California’s overall lower death rate throughout most of 2020
suggests that their stringent health measures may have mitigated
mortality more effectively than Ohio’s moderate approach. This
difference did not seem to matter during the winter surge as they both
had similar rates and increases at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 Analysis:</strong> This plot depicts Ohio’s COVID-19
positivity rate over time in relation to the Stringency Index and
Containment Health Index. Early in the pandemic, the positivity rate
showed extreme variability which is likely due to testing availability
and early case surges. The indices stabilized around mid-2020 and the
positivity rates showed periodic increases especially during Winter
2020. The indices, however, did not increase until after high positivity
rates showing they were more reactive than proactive for
containment.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong> <strong>Analysis:</strong> This figure
shows California’s COVID-19 positivity rate in relation to the
Stringency Index and Containment Health Index. Similar to Ohio, the
positivity rate showed high variability at the start of the pandemic
likely due to testing availability and early infections. The rate
eventually remained relatively low until late 2020 similar to Ohio.
California maintained higher containment and stringency measures
throughout this period but still had high rates of transmission during
the winter.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5 Analysis:</strong> The plot shows the trends in
Ohio’s COVID-19 death rate alongside the Stringency Index and
Containment Health Index. Overall, the death rate steadily increased
throughout 2020 with a sharp spike both in Winter 2020 and early 2021.
The indices fluctuated with a sharp increase at the start of the
pandemic but declined during the Summer. The indices did not increase
during the winter suggesting that this approach may have contributed to
the sharp rise in the death rate during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6 Analysis:</strong> This figure highlights
California’s cumulative COVID-19 death rate alongside the Stringency
Index and Containment Health Index. The death rate overall rose steadily
between the start of the pandemic and the summer but had a sharp
increase during the winter surge in late 2020 and early 2021. California
had overall high containment and stringency measures throughout 2020
reflecting its proactive approach. This overall showed limited
effectiveness during the winter surge, likely due to these
recommendations not being followed for gatherings. This demonstrates
that high transmission periods cannot be entirely mitigated without
broad compliance and vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>Figures 7 and 8 Analysis:</strong> These figures compare
COVID-19 death rates in Ohio and California from May to July 2020, a
time that was transitioning from initial lockdown to reopening, with key
policy interventions during this period. California opened in May with
clearer restrictions outlined in Stage 2 “Blueprint for a Safer Economy”
but then proceeded with indoor closures July 13 due to increased cases.
This overall led to a lower death rate increase with a slope of 0.1781
during this time period. Ohio did not implement a mask mandate until
July 8 but was only necessary for high-risk counties. Finally, Ohio made
a statewide mask mandate July 23 in response to the rising cases. This
lax response may explain the higher increase in death rate when compared
to California as shown by the higher slope of 0.2147 during this time
period.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This analysis highlights the differences in COVID-19 positivity and
death rates between California, Ohio, and the national average during
the pre-vaccine period (March 2020 – April 2021). California’s proactive
and stringent measures, including early restrictions and consistent
containment policies, resulted in a lower cumulative death rate (Table
1) and a more gradual increase in mortality compared to Ohio (Figure 2).
However, during the winter surge of late 2020, both states experienced
similar trends in positivity (Figure 1) and death rates (Figure 2),
underscoring the limitations of public health measures without broad
compliance and vaccination.</p>
<p>Ohio’s more reactive approach, with delayed mask mandates and less
stringent containment policies, corresponded to a higher death rate
increase during critical periods (Figures 5 and 7). California, despite
its consistently higher containment and stringency measures (Figures 4
and 6), faced challenges during periods of high transmission,
particularly during the summer and winter, as reflected in its initially
higher positivity rates (Figure 1) and subsequent mortality trends
(Figure 6). This analysis also revealed that state-level strategies
likely caused different health outcomes during the same period of time
(Figures 7 and 8).</p>
<p>Overall, this analysis underscores the importance of timely and
sustained public health interventions, as well as the need for broader
compliance, to effectively mitigate the spread and impact of
pandemics.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>Based on this analysis, future analyses could compare California to a
state with similar population demographics as well as even less
stringent policies than Ohio, such as Florida. This would provide
additional insight into how varying levels of government intervention
influence pandemic outcomes. Statistical modelling could also be done,
such as regression or time-series analyses, which could quantify the
associations between stringency measures, positivity rates, and death
rates.</p>
